# Decision Tree for Breast Cancer Detection

## 📖 Description

This project uses a Decision Tree to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features in the Breast Cancer dataset.

## 🧠 Model Explanation

Decision Trees split data by feature thresholds to build a tree-like model. It’s easy to interpret and visualize.

## ✅ Benefits

Easy to understand and visualize

Handles both numerical and categorical data

## ⚠️ Limitations

Prone to overfitting

Can be unstable (small changes in data = different tree)

## 📊 Dataset

Name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Source: scikit-learn

Features: Radius, texture, perimeter, etc.

Target: Malignant or Benign
