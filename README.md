# Decision Tree for Breast Cancer Detection

## 📖 Description

This project uses a Decision Tree to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features in the Breast Cancer dataset.

## 🧠 Model Explanation

A Decision Tree is a model used in machine learning that helps a computer make decisions. It's like a flowchart or a series of questions that lead to a final answer or decision.

Think of it like 20 Questions — each question you ask helps you get closer to the correct answer.

🎯 Goal of a Decision Tree

To predict something (like whether an email is spam or not, or whether a person will buy a product) by asking questions based on the data.

## ✅ Benefits

Easy to understand and visualize

Handles both numerical and categorical data

## ⚠️ Limitations

Prone to overfitting

Can be unstable (small changes in data = different tree)

## 📊 Dataset

Name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Source: scikit-learn

Features: Radius, texture, perimeter, etc.

Target: Malignant or Benign
